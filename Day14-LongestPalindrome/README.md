<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<h2>Longest Palindrome</h2>

Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.<br>
This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.<br>

**Note:** <br>
Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.<br>

>**Example:** <br>
>Input:"abccccdd"<br>
>Output:7<br>
>*Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.* <br>
